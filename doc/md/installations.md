#  ISSUE-TRACKER INSTALLATIONS AND CONFIGURATION GUIDE


    

## 1. INTRODUCTION


    

### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the tasks and activities to be performed in order to achieve a fully operational issue-tracker application instance. 

    

### 1.2. Document status
This document is updated constantly in every release of the issue-tracker. Each version however is considered to be a complete version regarding the issue-tracker version it situated in.

    

### 1.3. Audience
This document is aimed for everyone, who shall, will or even would like to interact with an issue-tracker application instance. Although this guide is aimed to be fully implementable via copy paste by following top to bottom, you need to have basic understanding of networking, protocols and Linux in order to complete the full installation, as your mealige will vary...

    

### 1.4. Master storage and storage format
The master storage of this document is the master branch of the issue-tracker release you are interested in. The main storage format is Markdown. 

    

### 1.5. Version control
The contents of this document MUST be updated according to the EXISTING features, functionalities and capabilities of the issue-tracker version, in which this document residues.

    

### 1.6. Process
The issue-tracker provides a mean for tracking of this documentation contents to the source code per feature/functionality, thus should you find inconsistencies in the behavior of the application and the content of this document you should create a bug issue and assign it to the owner of your product instance.

    

## 2. OS LEVEL ACCESS
The issue-tracker has been deployed on Ubuntu OS running virtual machines , physical hosts and aws instances. 

    

### 2.1. OS level access via aws
This section will provide you with the instructions to instantiate an Ubuntu 16 micro instance in AWS. Should create an AWS account if you have not yet one â€¦ 

    

#### 2.1.1. Launch a new instance
Go to your management console's by clicking Services-EC2 ( note I am using the region=eu-west-1, you might be using a different one ) :
https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=monitoring
Click on the blue "launch instance" button. 

    

##### 2.1.1.1. Choose an Ubuntu AMI
Scroll down the list. Choose the "Canonical, Ubuntu, 16.04 LTS, amd64 xenial image build on 2018-05-22" AMI. Click on select

    

##### 2.1.1.2. Select the type of instance
Choose the type of instance - I am using t2.micro, which is supposed to be free "freetire eligible". Click on the review and Launch ( you could continue configuring till the end of the wizard but you should be ok with the defaults by now

    

#### 2.1.2. Open ports 
In the AWS menu click Services - EC2. Click on the left on the security groups. If you configured an explicit security group, select it by clicking on the check box next to it, if you did not that click on the check box to the default security group created something like "launch-wizard-1 created 2018-07-03T14:39:25.644+03:00", where the latest string is the time when you launched the instance. 
Click on Actions - edit inbound rules - open the 3000 and 8080 tcp ports ( the default ones used by the mojo and hypnotoad malicious web servers) 

    

#### 2.1.3. Create a key-pair to access the instance via ssh
Click on the key-pairs in the left. Create a new one. Download the file in a path you could navigate later on to. I am using for example the following path:

    /opt/csitea/issue-tracker/dat/sec/key-pair-issue-tracker.pem

#### 2.1.4. Access the running instance via ssh.
Run the following commands, by replacing the ssh_server with the value taken from the "Private DNS" of the running instance. 

    export ssh_user=ubuntu
    export ssh_server=ec2-31-223-97-157.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
    export key_pair_file=/opt/csitea/issue-tracker/dat/sec/key-pair-issue-tracker.pem
    
    ssh -i $key_pair_file $ssh_user@$ssh_server

## 3. LIBS AND BINARIES INSTALLATIONS ON OS LEVEL


    

### 3.1. Check you can sudo with the ubuntu user
You should be able to sudo with your ubuntu user. 

    # set a nice informative prompt
    export PS1="\h [\d \t] [\w] $ \n\n  "
    
    sudo su - 

### 3.2. Add the issue-tracker application OS user's group
The current "as simpliest as possible" setup is to use a separate OS group for the user of the issue-tracker application. 
The name of the group could be anything, as well it's gid , use those values if you do not want to make additional own configurations. 

    export group=grp_it
    export gid=10001
    sudo groupadd -g "$gid" "$group"
    sudo cat /etc/group | grep --color "$group"

### 3.3. Add the issue-tracker application OS user
Add the user as shown bellow. The name of the user could be also anyting, as log as it belongs to the above configured group. 

    export user=usr_it
    export uid=10001
    export home_dir=/home/$user
    export desc="the hadoop group"
    #how-to add an user
    sudo useradd --uid "$uid" --home-dir "$home_dir" --gid "$group" \
    --create-home --shell /bin/bash "$user" \
    --comment "$desc"
    sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep --color "$user"
    groups "$user"

### 3.4. Add the issue-tracker app user to the sudoers group
Edit the /etc/group

    sudo:x:27:ubuntu,usr_it

### 3.5. Allow sudo without having to type password 
Add the following text to the /etc/sudoers file:

    # See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:
    usr_it  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

### 3.6. Install the git binary
You will need the git binary to fetch the issue-tracker source - you could alternatively download its zip fille. 

    sudo apt-get install build-essential git

### 3.7. Fetch the source
Fetch the source from git hub as follows:

    # got to a dir you have write permissions , for example:
    mkdir -p ~/opt/; cd ~/opt/
    
    # fetch the source
    git clone https://github.com/YordanGeorgiev/issue-tracker.git
    
    # checkit
    ls -la 
    

### 3.8. run the boot-strap script
The bootstrap script will interpolate change the git deployment dir to a "product_instance_dir" ( your instance of the issue-tracker, having the same version as this one, but running on a different host with different owner - your )

    # defiine the latest and greates product_version
    export product_version=$(cd issue-tracker;git tag|sort -nr| head -n 1;cd ..)
    
    # check it 
    echo $product_version
    
    # run the bootstrap script : 
    bash issue-tracker/src/bash/issue-tracker/bootstrap-issue-tracker.sh

### 3.9. Install the OS libs listed in the prereq sh script
The "prereq"script contains the listing of the binaries to be installed. Run the script. 

    # go to your product instance dir - 
    cd ~/opt/csitea/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.$product_version.dev.$USER
    sudo bash src/bash/issue-tracker/install-prerequisites-on-ubuntu.sh

### 3.10. Install the Perl modules listed in the preq pl scriipt
The Perl modules installation looks ALWAYS, yet it usually goes trough without any googling of sessions etc. 

    # go to your product instance dir - 
    cd /opt/csitea/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.$product_version.dev.$USER
    sudo perl src/perl/issue_tracker/script/issue_tracker_preq_checker.pl

### 3.11. Disable the warnings in the OAuth2.pm
As many of the actions in the issue-tracker this is simply a one-liner. 

    vim /usr/local/share/perl/5.22.1/Net/Google/DataAPI/Auth/OAuth2.pm
    # edit the use Any::Moose; line as follows:
    
    no warnings 'deprecated';
    use Any::Moose;
    use warnings 'deprecated' ;

### 3.12. Check that the project source code 
As many of the actions in the issue-tracker this is simply a one-liner. You should not get any errors after the execution of this one , if there are probably some prerequisite module has not been included in the prerequisite script ( although we have tested those several times ... ). So you would either have to install it by yourself or troubleshoot why it does not install. 

    bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a check-perl-syntax

## 5. LOAD THE ISSUE-TRACKER PROJECT DATA


    

### 5.1. Edit and pre-load the project env vars configuration file
As the issue-tracker supports loading data for multiple instances of itself - dev,tst,prd AND multiple pre-configured projects, YOU MUST have a shell with the pre-configured set of environmental variables in order to achieve ANY of the actions.

    # load the bash func to parse the conf files
    source lib/bash/funcs/parse-cnf-env-vars.sh
    
    doParseCnfEnvVars cnf/issue-tracker.dev.$(hostname -s).cnf

### 5.2. Create the database and run the DDL scrripts


    bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a run-pgsql-scripts

### 5.3. Start the mojo and hypno servers
The morbo dev server is listening on the 3000 port by default and the hypnotoad on the 8080 by default. You will need to use either one when loading the tables in the next step. 

    bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a mojo-morbo-stop ; bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a mojo-morbo-start
    
    bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a mojo-hypnotoad-stop ; bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a mojo-hypnotoad-start

### 5.4. Load the data from the xls file
Load the data to the db from the xls file

    clear ; export tables=`curl -s -k http://$web_host:8080/$postgres_db_name/select-tables|jq -r '.| .dat| .[] | .table_name'|perl -ne 's/\s+/,/g;print'`;export do_truncate_tables=1 ; export rdbms_type=postgres ; export load_model=upsert ; perl src/perl/issue_tracker/script/issue_tracker.pl --tables $tables --do xls-to-db

### 5.5. Verify that the app layer and the db work together
In the aws menu click Services - EC2. Click on the instances on the left. Check the public DNS name of your instance and use it for the URL as follows:
http://ec2-34-243-97-157.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/dev_issue_tracker/list/yearly_issues?as=table&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=20&page-num=1
