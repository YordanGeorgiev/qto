## 1. INTRODUCTION


    

### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this  document is to describe all the features, functionalities and capabilities provided by a properly installed, configured and operated instance of the qto application for the perspective of an application end-user.
This document is the CONTRACT between you as the potential, former or active user of an qto instance and the product owner of that instance. Thus, should something here be described to work in a particular way, contrarian of your user experience, you should create an issue and assign it to your instance owner. 


    

### 1.2. Document status 
This document is updated constantly in every release of the qto. Each version however is considered to be a complete version regarding the qto version it situated in.

    

### 1.3. Audience
This document could be of interest for any potential and actual end-users of the qto application.

    

### 1.4. Master storage and storage format
The master storage of this document is the _doc table of the production database of the instance you are using. 

    

### 1.5. Version control
The contents of this document MUST be updated according to the EXISTING features, functionalities and capabilities of the qto version, in which this document residues.
The version of this document is the same as the version of the qto application. Place your mouse over the upper left corner displaying the database name this document is served from. 

    

### 1.6. Process
The qto provides a mean for tracking of this documentation contents to the source code per feature/functionality, thus should you find inconsistencies in the behaviour of the application and the content of this document you should create a bug issue by clicking on the plus button of the enduser_issues and assign it to the owner of your product instance. 

    

## 2. CONCEPTS
This section describes the User Interface ( UI ) features of the qto application, which are accessible from an internet browser accessing a running instance of the qto application.
Note that, each time the application displays an error in the UI a more technical error is logged in the javascript console ...

    

### 2.1. Support for different projects
You could access multiple projects by accessing their project databases as the first URI path component provided that the web server has tcp access to those databases. 

    

### 2.2. Change projects via url
The following 2 different databases are actually the tst and dev databases of the qto, but of course the database names could be any valid other database names:

https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

Note the upper left corner of the page contains the name of your current project database. 

    # access the qto's project development database
    http://host-name:3000/qto/list/monthly_issues
    
    # access the qto's project testing database
    http://host-name:3000/qto/list/monthly_issues
    
    # access the aspark-starter project production database
    http://host-name:3000/prd_aspark_starter/list/monthly_issues

### 2.3. Switch projects by the :to operator in the search-box
If you type the ":to &lt;&lt;database-name&gt;&gt;" you will get a drop down which will list the projects databases , to which your instance has access to, by choosing the database from the list and hitting enter you will be redirected to the same url by on the different database.

    

### 2.4. Switch items by using the :for operator in the search-box
If you type the ":in &lt;&lt;item-name&gt;&gt;" you will get a drop down which will list the items , to which your instance has access to, by choosing the item from the list and hitting enter you will be redirected to the same url by on the different database.
You can combine both the ":in &lt;&lt;db&gt;&gt;" and ":for &lt;&lt;item&gt;&gt;" operators at once. 

    

## 3. LOGIN
You need to sent e-mail to the e-mail of the administrator of the qto application ( just try to login with your e-mail and you will get this e-mail in the error msg ). 

    

### 3.1. Own password change
After you have the password from the administrator change it immidiately after login from the &lt;&lt;app&gt;&gt;/list/users page. You can see only your own password - once you have updated it it gets stored encrypted in the database and even the user administrator cannot read it in clear text. 

    

## 4. THE LIST PAGE
The list page presents part or the whole content of a database by the means of UI controls - dynamic html table, forms etc. 
In the context of the qto's parley the "listing" is the ui list of control/(s) you get by using the following URL format:

    http://<<web-host>>:<<web-port>>/<<proj-db-name>>/list/<<item>>?as&<<ui-type>>&<<listing-params>>

### 4.1. List items 
The common listing syntax components are as follows:
- web-host is the web-host the qto's web instances is accessible from
- web-port - the web port the instance is accessible from 
- proj-db-name is the name of the database of your project ( as the qto supports multiple projects , with multiple databases ... )
- list - is the name of the action to perform 
- item is the name of the item which ui controls you want to list ( could be issues, problems, questions, etc.
- ?&lt;&lt;params&gt;&gt; the additional url parameters used to control the look and behaviour of the listing action, should the url params be omitted the full content of the item table with default ui look and behaviour are displayed. 

    http://host-name:3000/qto/list/monthly_issues

#### 4.1.1. Viewing the full content of the items
You can quickly view the full content of each cell of the listing table by hovering with the mouse on top of it. Note that all the links in the content are replaced with clickable links in the tooltip as well as the internal links such as the following one : enduser_guide_doc-190214225314( which just refer to the upper title in this document.

    

#### 4.1.2. Successful execution for list items
You can use the pick=col1, col2, col3 url parameter to select for only desired attributes.
You could filter the result the same way the filters for the select page work ( see bellow ). 

    

#### 4.1.3. Error handling for non-existent db on list-items
If the db provided in the url pattern does not exist an error is shown in the top of the page in a visually distinctive manner, after which the msg fades out. Example url:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/non_existent/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done




    

#### 4.1.4. Error handling for non-existent item table
If the item table requested does not exist an error is shown in the top of the page in a visually distinctive manner, after which the msg fades out. Example:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/non_existent_table?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

    

#### 4.1.5. Error handling for non-existent column
If the column requested does not exist an error is shown in the top of the page in a visually distinctive manner, after which the msg fades out.
Example:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=NON_EXISTENT,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

    

#### 4.1.6. Listing url syntax
The listing url syntax mimics the sql select clause syntax, yet in much more simplified form.

    

##### 4.1.6.1. The "pick" url param
You can use the pick=col1,col2,col3 url parameter to select for only desired attributes to be show in the ui control used for listing.
The following url demonstrates this syntax:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/prd_qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

    

##### 4.1.6.2. The "hide" url param
If you do not specify any attribute to pick, you could hide specific attributes by using the "hide=col1,col2,col3" syntax.
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?hide=description

    

##### 4.1.6.3. The "with=col-operator-value" filter
You can filter the result of the query by using the "with=col-operator-value". The following examples demonstrates, which operators are supported.
An error message is shown if you do not use existing operator. 
The following url demonstrates this syntax:
http://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done
Note when going to the next page that all the rows' status is 09-done

    with=status-eq-09-done
    list all the items having the attribute "status" equal to the "09-done" string
    
    with=prio-lt-7
    list all the items having the attribute prio smaller than the number 7
    
    this is the list of all the operators supported
           'eq' => '='
         , 'ne' => '<>'
         , 'gt' => '>'
         , 'lt' => '<'
         , 'ge' => '>='
         , 'le' => '<='
         , 'like' => 'like'
    
    

##### 4.1.6.4. The "where=col-operator-value" filter
You can filter the result of the query by using the "where=col-operator-value", which works exactly as the with operator, thus the following examples demonstrates, which operators are supported.
An error message is shown if you do not use existing operator. 

    with=status-eq-09-done
    list all the items having the attribute "status" equal to the "09-done" string
    
    with=prio-lt-7
    list all the items having the attribute prio smaller than the number 7
    
    this is the list of all the operators supported
           'eq' => '='
         , 'ne' => '<>'
         , 'gt' => '>'
         , 'lt' => '<'
         , 'ge' => '>='
         , 'le' => '<='
         , 'like' => 'like'
    
    

##### 4.1.6.5. Filtering with "like"
The filtering with the like operator translates to the SQL "like" operator- the "like-by=&lt;&lt;attr&gt;&gt;&like-val=&lt;&lt;val&gt;&gt; filtering, where &lt;&lt;attr&gt;&gt; stands for the name of the attribute to use the like operator. 
Example:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&like-by=status&like-val=03

    # this example url will list all the monthly_issues items having the "bug" string in their "name" attribute:
    http://host-name:3000/qto/list/monthly_issues?as=grid&like-by=name&like-val=bug

### 4.2. Sorting an item table
The listed table is sortable by clicking on the columns OR by navigating with the tab key on the keyboard on a column and hitting Enter. 
The sorted column is visually shown as the active one on page load:
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=grid&oa=prio&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=5&page-num=1&where=status-eq-09-done

    

### 4.3. Quick filtering an item table
You can filter the already presented part of the result set in the page by using the search textbox. This is only an ui type of filtering for the already loaded data. This type of filtering is different compared to the url parameters filtering by using the with url param syntax and it filters the already fetched from the db data-set, whereas the with=&lt;&lt;attribute&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;operator&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt; filtering does filter on the database side.
You could focus the quick search textbox by pressing the forward slash on your keyboard. 
The quick search box works instantaneously, thus hitting enter is not needed. 

    

### 4.4. Setting the item table paging size
You can set the page size of the result set to be fetched from the database by using the "&page-size=&lt;&lt;page-size&gt;&gt;" url parameter or by clicking on the page sizes links bellow the table.
The default and most convenient table paging size is 7, because it allows quick paging of a small result-set without scrolling on the screen ...  

    

### 4.5. Paging - setting the item table's page number
If the result-set requested is larger than the page size you can go to the next page number by using the "&page-num=&lt;&lt;page-num&gt;&gt;" url parameter. 
You could go to the next page number by clicking on the links just bellow the quick search textbox. The table control has UI for setting the table page number. 
The pager shows 10 pages at a "pager page" so getting to the end of hundreds of pages ( depending of course on your page size ) is comparably easy. 
You could quickly use the / char shortcut to focus to the quick search box and from there use the tab to quickly navigate to the desired page number. 

    

### 4.6. Item table paging
The table paging is decided by the pg-num=&lt;&lt;page-number&gt;&gt; and the pg-size=&lt;&lt;page-size&gt;&gt; url operators. 

    

### 4.7. Keyboard usability in the list page
The order of all the ui elements of the list-as-grid page has been arranged so that the user could cycle trough the whole page by accessing all the elements quickly.
Power-users will find it extremely convenient to cycle and edit small tables.

    

#### 4.7.1. Navigability of the list page with the keyboard

You can quickly traverse the cells of the table via the tab key, which does go over the non-editable items too ( the id's ) , so that you could quickly scroll the table as scrolling when the editable is in focus does not work. 
The whole table is easily scrollable whenever the cursor is on non-editable part of the table ( the id's column ) and whenever the last rows must be edited the page is scrolled so that the rows are situated in the middle and not the bottom of the screen. 

    

#### 4.7.2. Focus the quick search box
You could focus the quick search by typing / IF you are not editing a cell. Thus the paging on the next cell is quite handy - as you could easily jump onto the quick search and with couple of tabs navigate to the next page. 

    

#### 4.7.3. Undo the edit on a cell
If you were on a cell and types some text without leaving it, but you change your mind you could simply press the Esc key, which will restore the original content of the cell and you could proceed by tab to the next cell. 

    

#### 4.7.4. Keyboard navigation on the edit form
You could open the edit form with the keyboard while your cursors is on the id button of the item in the grid ( Note that the colour of the button text has to change also. By hitting enter the edit form will open witch the title id selected, from there you could cycle with the tab on each control of the form, thus each time the focus leaves a control the data updated or not is saved to the database. You could close the form by hitting enter when the close button is selected. 

    

### 4.8. New item creation (CREATE)
A new item could be added to the table in the ui and thus in the db table by clicking the plus button above the table ( which uses the google material design ui ). 
The new button has a fixed position, thus available during scrolling as well from the same position. 
The new button changes it's appears when focused via the keyboard, and can be pressed when in focus by hitting enter with the keyboard. 
To practice new items' creations and deletions to get comfortable on the app's behaviour please use first the development instances of the qto project: 
enduser_guide_doc-190214224310:8080/qto/list/monthly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=5&page-num=1

    

#### 4.8.1. Successful execution
After clicking the plus button the System adds the new row into the database table and presents it into the table ui AS THE FIRST ROW to emphasise the created row - that is the existing sort of the table is changed to the id column. Note that if you had a defined sorting order before the addition of the new item, it has been replaced by the "order by the latest created" sorting order. 

    

#### 4.8.2. Error handling on db create error
If any error occurs while the creation an error msg is presented clearly with fading effect, which returns the error msg from the database. 
On invalid input the data is not created to the database and nothing is stored. 

    

### 4.9. Item edit (UPDATE)
There are 2 ways to edit an item of the qto application :
 - inline edit
 - form edit

    

#### 4.9.1. Form edit
You open the form to edit an item from the id button on the left. A modal dialog containing the filled in details of the item appears. You could either simply cycle via the keyboard trough the items, or edit some of the item details, as soon as any of the controls in the form is selected, after leaving the control the data is saved straight to the database. 

    

#### 4.9.2. In-line edit ( UPDATE )
The grid can be edited inline so that the data is updated to the database. White space in the cells is preserved. 
To practice new items' creations updates and deletions to get comfortable on the app's behaviour please use first the development instances of the qto project: 
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/monthly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=5&page-num=1

    

##### 4.9.2.1. Table columns resizing
You can resize the columns of the tables to a max size of 500 pixels by dragging only one text area. Note however that the textarea will NOT be resized bigger than the maximum width of the current column … 
For the visual outlook of the table a certain default values for certain columns' contents widths are assumed.

    

##### 4.9.2.2. Contents for the table's cells
The table's cells should accept any UTF-8 characters including html entities. The textarea's width should adjust automatically till the width of the widest cell in the table column.

    

##### 4.9.2.3. Successful execution
If the single cell inline-edit is successful no msg is presented and the data is updated to the database storage.
If the updated cell was part of the currently sorted column the ui is automatically adjusted to the new sort order ( for example if a numeric sort was applied and the cell had value of 9 with 1..9 range and the smallest to greatest was currently active if the new update is 1 the item will appear in the top of the listing.

    

##### 4.9.2.4. Error handling on db update error
If any error occurs while updating an error msg is presented clearly with fading effect, which returns the error msg from the database. 
On invalid input the data is not updated to the database and the old value in the cell is restored.

    

##### 4.9.2.5. Nulls handling
Nulls handling is somewhat problematic in ui. For now the behaviour by convention is to leave a nullable record in the database as null, whether the cell of the ui table is left empty ( white space chars are also considered empty)

    

### 4.10. Item deletion ( DELETE )
You could delete items by clicking the delete button with the trash icon in the beginning of every item. 
To practice new items' creations and deletions to get comfortable on the app's behaviour please use first the development instances of the qto project: 
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/monthly_issues?as=grid&pick=id,status,prio,name,weight,start_time,stop_time&page-size=5&page-num=1

    

#### 4.10.1. Successful execution
If the deletion is successful the item is removed both from the ui and from the database. No msg is presented the table just got smaller ! ...

    

#### 4.10.2. Error handling on delete error
The usual way if an error has occurred during the delete the error msg is displayed in the top centre  area of the list page.

    

### 4.11. List as print-table page
The list as print-table page is aimed at producing quickly refined result-set from the database for a further copy paste on to another html page ( wiki etc. )  or even print to paper. 
It has all the functionalities as the list as "table" page, without the filtering from the quick search box and without the ui for the pager and page-sizer -the url params for paging and page-sizing work, however. All the url params work as in the grid listing page. 
https://ec2-52-213-247-228.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/qto/list/yearly_issues?as=print-table&pick=id,status,name,description&page-size=5&page-num=1&like-by=status&like-val=03

    

## 5. THE VIEW AS DOC PAGE
The view page presents the data of a database table, having nested-set hierarchical model partially or fully by the means of different controls. The page is shortly called the view-doc page

    

### 5.1. Normal page load
When the page is loaded all the content of the document is presented / according to the urls params / which are applying the same filtering as in the list page , but on the hierarchical data-set …
The right menu, containing the table of contents of the document can be opened and closed and scrolled separately




When the page is loaded all the content of the document is presented / according to the urls params / which are applying the same filtering as in the list page , but on the hierarchical data-set …
The right menu, containing the table of contents of the document can be opened and closed and scrolled separately

### 5.2. Error handling for page-load
Should there be an error a dynamic snackbar is presented with the error message. The snackbar hides itself by default after 3.9 seconds ( set by default , but it could be pinned to the page by the user to view it properly / send it further). 
Whenever an error occurs the show right menu button does not occur and no document is presented

    <<web-host>>:<<web-port>>/<<database>>/view/<<table-name>>?as=doc

### 5.3. The right click menu
You open and close the right click menu from the upper menu icon. The right click menu presents the structure of the document.You could navigate with the keyboard trough the right menu links too. 
Note that when you click on a link on the right menu the title of the item you clicked on is scrolled to the top of the page.
Right click on the title items presents the context menu containing several different options to perform on a branch of the document. 

    

### 5.4. Items interlinking
The items interlinking works both in the list-grid and in the view-doc pages ( the description ).
Any &lt;&lt;item&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;id&gt;&gt; where &lt;&lt;id&gt;&gt; is a whole number is converted into the jump to the anchor of that exact item id of that &lt;&lt;item&gt;&gt;. 
For example :
enduser_guide_doc-190214224374 will generate a link to this "items interlinking" title ( Hold on the Ctrl key and click on the link in the tooltip on the right of this paragraph. 
The interlinking works between the different items as well :
For example:
requirements_doc-1
If the item is not a "doc" item - aka not ending with the _doc the link will redirect the user to a filtered table with only this id: 
for example: principles-1805311658

    

## 6. THE EXPORT URI
The export url follows the same syntax naming conventions as the list page , but instead of presenting a list with the data it exports it in the specified with "as" url parameter format. 

    <<web-host>>:<<web-port>>/<<database>>/export/<<table-name>>?as=xls

### 6.1. Export branch to xls
To export data via the export url you could apply any of the listing parameters and replace the list web action with the export one and the as=&lt;&lt;control&gt; to the as=xls and the application will present you with a save file dialog with the desired data. 

    <<web-host>>:<<web-port>>/<<database>>/export/<<table-name>>?as=xls

### 6.2. Export branch to md
To export a document via the export url you could apply any of the listing parameters and replace the view web action with the export one and the as=&lt;&lt;control&gt; to the as=md and the application will present you with a save file dialog with a generated md document with the desired data
