## 2. CORE CONCEPTS


    

### 2.1. Time intervals based time-management
The time rules our lifes. Issue-tracker is aimed to help you and your organisation to manage your time and resources in the best possible way YOU CAN. You must make sure that you clearly define and state your issues and update their information based on the events from the real world.

    

### 2.2. Personal responsibility
You should assign 0 or 1 persons responsible for an issue at a time. Of course if you keep tool long an issue to be assigned to nobody it simply means that you are not fully committed to its completion. 

    

## 3. BUSINESS LOGIC


    

### 3.1. Projects management
You can manage multiple projects with the issue-tracker tool. Each project has its own data directories, database storage and configurations. You could also have different envornments named dev,tst,prd for each project separately. 
As the tool is backwards compatible you could have differrrent instances of the issue-tracker projects with different versions ( and set of features ) operatiing against differrent project ( each one in its own version).
You must pre-set the configuration variables of an issue-tracker project each time you start working on a project from the shell

    doParseIniEnvVars /vagrant/csitea/cnf/projects/isg-pub/isg-pub.issue-tracker.doc-pub-host.conf

### 3.2. Increase the date for all projects
to increase the date for all the projects at once use the following oneliner.

    while read -r f ; do doParseIniEnvVars $f ; bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a increase-date ; done < <(find doParseIniEnvVars /vagrant/csitea/cnf/projects/issue-tracker/ -type f)

### 3.3. Categories
Each issue item could be categorized under one and only one category. One category might have 1 or more issues. 
The categories could contain letters ,numbers, dashes

    Examples:
    organisation-it
    organisation-it-operations

#### 3.3.1. Issues / Issue items / items
Issue item is the shortest possible description of task , activity , note or anything requiring distinguishable and prerferable measurable action or producing verfifiable outcome.
Issues could be of different types - tasks, activities, notes etc. 

    Examples:
    go get the milk
    do the homework
    procurement e-mail discussion follow-up

#### 3.3.2. to search for the project daily file
to search for the project daily file run the following liner first to start the dev server of the react mini-app.
Than point your broser at the following url:
http://doc-pub-host:3307/
( Hardcoded for now â€¦ ) 

    bash src/bash/issue-tracker/issue-tracker.sh -a mojo-morbo-start
